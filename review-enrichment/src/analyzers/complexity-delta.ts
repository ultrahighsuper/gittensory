// Real before/after complexity-delta analyzer (#4740, part of epic #4737's REES/deterministic-tier phase).
// complexity.ts's own `complexity` analyzer explicitly disclaims being a true before/after delta: it normally
// only sees diff hunks, so it can only score a NEWLY-ADDED function (whose opening line is in the diff) against
// a fixed absolute threshold -- a function whose signature is unchanged but whose BODY was edited gets no score
// at all, so a PR that meaningfully SIMPLIFIES a gnarly existing function gets no credit. This analyzer closes
// that gap using the shared reconstructOldContent primitive (#4739): fetch the changed file's post-PR content at
// headSha (the same authed GitHub contents-API fetch doc-comment-drift.ts/exhaustiveness-drift.ts already
// perform for their own purposes), reverse-apply the patch to recover the pre-PR text, run complexity.ts's OWN
// decision-point counting logic (`scanContentForComplexity` -- reused unchanged, not reimplemented) against BOTH
// versions, match functions by name, and diff the two scores.
//
// Registered as a SEPARATE AnalyzerName (`complexityDelta`) rather than folded into `complexity`'s existing
// entry -- see complexity.ts's header for the full reasoning. Short version: merging this network-dependent,
// before/after logic into `complexity`'s single `requires`/`cost` would either (a) gate `complexity`'s existing
// free, local, always-available absolute-threshold check behind `github-token`/`head-sha`, regressing it
// whenever either is unavailable (scheduler.ts's skipReasonForAnalyzer skips a descriptor's `run` entirely based
// on its DECLARED `requires`, before ever calling it -- this is real scheduling behavior, not just docs), or (b)
// mislabel this genuinely network-costed half as `cost: "local"`, letting it dodge the `github-light`
// concurrency/timeout budget and the `fast` profile's network-free guarantee. Two honestly-classified
// descriptors instead of one dishonest one.
//
// A function whose name recurs more than once in either version (ambiguous -- same rule
// scanContentForComplexity/doc-comment-drift.ts's extractFunctionParams already apply) is excluded from
// matching. A function present only in the NEW version has no "before" to diff against -- that is exactly
// `complexity`'s own job, not this analyzer's. A wholly-added file (reconstructOldContent's `""` return) or an
// unreconstructable patch (`null`) are both "no usable before content" and degrade to zero delta findings for
// that file, never a crash -- checked via plain truthiness, NEVER a strict `=== null` compare (see
// reconstruct-old-content.ts's own doc comment: an empty string is falsy but `!== null`, so a strict-null check
// would wrongly treat a brand-new file's "" as valid before-content).
