# Review-enrichment service (REES)

A standalone microservice that produces a structured **review brief** for the gittensory review engine. Run it
in-network alongside a self-hosted engine via the repo-root `docker-compose --profile rees` service (the simplest
path, no separate hosting to manage — see the [self-hosting REES docs](https://gittensory.aethereal.dev/docs/self-hosting-rees)),
or deploy it as its own service on any platform that can run a Dockerfile-based Node service — see
[Deploy (Railway)](#deploy-railway) below for one example.

The engine reviews PRs by running a headless `claude --print` subprocess with `Bash`/`WebFetch` disallowed and **no
repo checkout**, so it cannot run a linter, hit a CVE database, resolve a dependency tree, or query git history. REES
fills exactly that gap: given a PR it runs heavy/external/historical analysis and returns a pre-rendered, public-safe
brief the engine splices into the prompt next to grounding + RAG. It is strictly **additive and fail-safe** — the engine
treats any timeout/error as "no brief" and proceeds.

## API

| Route             | Purpose                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /health`     | Liveness health check.                                                          |
| `GET /ready`      | Readiness.                                                                      |
| `POST /v1/ping`   | Auth check only — the engine calls this at startup to verify the shared secret matches. Returns `{ok:true}` or 401. |
| `POST /v1/enrich` | `Authorization: Bearer <REES_SHARED_SECRET>` → `EnrichRequest` → `ReviewBrief`. |

> **Secret format:** `REES_SHARED_SECRET` must be set to the **same bare string** on both the engine and the REES
> service — no surrounding quotes, no extra whitespace. Both sides strip surrounding quotes and whitespace
> automatically, but the underlying values must match exactly. If the engine logs `rees_secret_mismatch` or
> `rees_secret_normalized` at startup, check that both env vars are set to the same literal string.

See `src/types.ts` for the `EnrichRequest` / `ReviewBrief` contract. When the engine is configured with
`REES_FORWARD_GITHUB_TOKEN=true`, requests can include a GitHub read token so token-aware analyzers can read
CODEOWNERS and blob sizes. Token forwarding is off by default and should be enabled only when the REES endpoint is
inside the operator's trust boundary. The engine prefers a short-lived installation token and falls back to
`GITHUB_PUBLIC_TOKEN`. The service must never log request bodies, diffs, or tokens.

The engine can send `analyzers: ["secret", "actionPin"]` to run a subset. If the field is omitted, REES runs the
full registry. An explicit empty array runs no analyzers; the engine uses that fail-closed shape when an
operator-configured analyzer list contains no valid names.

## Analyzer manifests

Analyzer runtime metadata lives in `src/analyzers/registry.ts` as `AnalyzerDescriptor` entries. New analyzer work
should prefer the modular shape introduced for `dependency` and `secret`:

| File                                      | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/analyzers/<name>/descriptor.ts`      | Analyzer name, title, category, cost, requirements, docs, run function, and optional renderer. |
| `src/analyzers/<name>.ts`                 | Pure scanner helpers and the analyzer implementation.          |
| `test/<name>.test.ts`                     | Focused tests for scanner behavior, rendering, and degradation. |

Descriptors are the extension point future REES runtime work will use for profiles, docs generation, scheduler cost
classes, per-analyzer limits, and self-host configuration. When adding or migrating an analyzer:

- Keep the public analyzer name stable; it is what `REES_ANALYZERS` and the engine request body use.
- Put operator-facing metadata in the descriptor: `category`, `cost`, `defaultEnabled`, `requires`, `limits`, and
  `docs`.
- Keep renderer output public-safe. Never include tokens, request bodies, diffs, raw prompts, comments, or private
  config values.
- Make external-call analyzers fail open and respect the orchestrator abort signal when the scanner supports it.
- Prefer a focused analyzer test file instead of expanding the shared `enrichment.test.ts` mega-test.

### Magic-number analyzer

`magicNumber` is a precision-first local analyzer for unexplained numeric literals added by a PR. It is intended to
surface values that look like policy, timing, sizing, retry, threshold, or scoring decisions hidden directly inside an
expression, where a named constant would make intent and future review safer.

The analyzer scans only added diff lines in non-test source files. It never fetches repository content, never
evaluates code, and never returns source snippets. Findings carry only `{ file, line, value }`, so the review brief can
say that `src/retry.ts:42` added `37` without copying the surrounding line.

What it reports:

- Numeric literals in expressions, such as `attempt * 37`, `timeout + 250`, `ratio > 0.73`, or `0xff` masks.
- Signed and fractional forms when they are part of the literal, such as `-42`, `.75`, `6e-3`, or `99n`.
- Multiple reportable values on one added line, capped by the analyzer-level finding limit.
- Added content whose source text begins with plus signs, matching the unified-diff edge cases covered by sibling
  analyzers.

What it suppresses:

- Test files and snapshot paths, because assertion literals are usually expected examples rather than production
  policy.
- Documentation, JSON/YAML, lockfiles, fixtures, and other non-source files.
- String literals and inline comments before numeric scanning, so prose like `"wait 37 seconds"` or `// retry in 42`
  does not generate a finding.
- Common sentinel and scale values: `0`, `1`, `-1`, `2`, `100`, `1000`, and powers of ten.
- Named constant declarations, including common language forms such as `const MAX_BATCH = 250`, `static readonly
  RETRY_WINDOW = 30`, `public static final int LIMIT = 50`, `final DEFAULT_LIMIT = 50`, and `val MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 250`.
- Array indexes like `rows[3]`, numeric object keys like `{ 404: handler }`, and enum-like member initializers like
  `PENDING = 3`.

The goal is not to ban numeric literals. It is to highlight newly-added non-obvious values that can silently encode
review-critical behavior. The analyzer favors false negatives over noisy findings: if a literal looks named,
structural, test-only, or conventional, it stays silent.

Example outcomes:

| Added source line | Analyzer result | Rationale |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| `const timeoutMs = attempts * 37;` | Reports `37`. | The value is embedded in behavior and is not self-describing. |
| `const RETRY_WINDOW_MS = 37;` | Suppressed. | The uppercase declaration gives the literal a reviewable name. |
| `if (ratio > 0.73) return true;` | Reports `0.73`. | Fractional thresholds are usually policy choices. |
| `return rows[3];` | Suppressed. | Small positional array indexes are structural. |
| `return items[:37];` | Reports `37`. | Slice bounds can encode a batch or display limit. |
| `{ 404: handleMissing }` | Suppressed. | Numeric object keys are commonly protocol or lookup labels. |
| `enum State { Pending = 3 }` | Suppressed. | Enum-like member initializers are named states. |
| `const mask = flags & 0xff;` | Reports `0xff`. | Radix literals can hide bitmask decisions. |
| `const sample = 1_337;` | Reports `1_337`. | Numeric separators keep the original literal readable in findings. |
| `const scale = 1000;` | Suppressed. | Powers and common scales are intentionally quiet. |

Operational notes:

- Keep findings public-safe: report the file, line, and literal only, never the surrounding source text.
- Use the diff hunk line number, not a best-effort grep against the repository checkout.
- Scan added lines only. Removed or context lines should never create findings.
- Apply the source-path filter before scanning content so generated metadata and docs stay quiet.
- Respect the abort signal both before and during patch scanning.
- Keep line-level work bounded; very long added lines are skipped to avoid pathological input.
- Preserve deterministic ordering by scanning files, hunks, and literals in diff order.
- Cap per-line and per-request findings so one generated file cannot dominate the brief.
- Add tests for both the reported and suppressed side of every new heuristic.
- Regenerate analyzer metadata whenever the registry descriptor changes.

## Shared analysis context

Each `/v1/enrich` request now gets a request-scoped `AnalysisContext` before analyzers run. New and migrated
analyzers should prefer it for shared PR facts instead of reparsing the envelope:

| Context surface | Purpose |
| --------------- | ------- |
| `changedFiles` / `changedFilePaths` | The request's changed file list and paths. |
| `addedLines` | Unified-diff added lines with file and new-line number tracking. |
| `patchHunks` | Parsed hunk locations for analyzers that need bounded line-aware scans. |
| `fileCategories` | Coarse public-safe file categories used for fast filtering. |
| `dependencyChanges()` / `packageChanges()` | Cached direct package changes from changed manifests. |
| `cachedExternalCall(category, key, load)` | Request-scoped in-flight de-duplication for identical external lookups. |

Context caches are request-scoped only. They are for avoiding duplicate work inside one enrichment run, not for
cross-request TTL storage. Cache metrics are aggregate and public-safe: hit/miss counts, external-call counts by
category, skipped/capped work counts by category, and elapsed time. Never put request bodies, diffs, prompts,
comments, tokens, private configs, or raw external payloads into cache categories, metric keys, Sentry tags, or logs.

The engine also sends `budget.timeoutMs` with one second of headroom below `REES_TIMEOUT_MS`, so REES can return a
partial/degraded brief before the caller aborts the HTTP request. If your REES deployment is still running an older
build, temporarily raise the engine-side `REES_TIMEOUT_MS` above the REES analyzer budget, or set `REES_ANALYZERS` to
a bounded list that excludes `history` until the budget-aware build is deployed.

## Run locally

```sh
npm install
REES_SHARED_SECRET=dev npm run build && npm start   # listens on :8080
curl localhost:8080/health
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/v1/enrich -H 'authorization: Bearer dev' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"repoFullName":"o/r","prNumber":1}'
```

## Deploy (Railway)

For a self-hosted engine, `docker compose --profile rees up -d` from the repo root (see the
[self-hosting REES docs](https://gittensory.aethereal.dev/docs/self-hosting-rees)) is the simplest path — no
separate service to host. If you'd rather run REES on its own outside that compose network, it's a plain
Dockerfile-based Node service and can go anywhere that builds one; Railway is one option this repo has release
tooling for (the Sentry/source-map wiring below). Point **Root Directory = `review-enrichment`** at a `railway.json`
you add there (see Railway's Dockerfile-builder docs) and set `REES_SHARED_SECRET` (same value the engine holds) as a
service variable — never commit it. The engine reaches the service over Railway **private networking**
(`<service>.railway.internal`); no public domain is required.

## Sentry releases and source maps

REES supports optional Sentry error reporting and source-map upload for Railway deployments. The Docker image builds
`dist/*.js.map` with embedded `sourcesContent`, then the runtime startup command injects Sentry debug ids, uploads the
exact post-injection `dist/` files, records a deploy, removes source maps from the running filesystem, and starts
`dist/server.js`.

Set these Railway service variables:

| Variable                       | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SENTRY_DSN`                   | Enables REES error capture. Unset means the SDK is a no-op.             |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`            | Allows the runtime uploader to create releases and upload source maps.  |
| `SENTRY_ORG`                   | Sentry organization slug.                                               |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT`               | Sentry project slug.                                                    |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`           | Optional; defaults to Railway's environment name, then `production`.    |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`    | Optional; defaults to `0`, so errors report without tracing.            |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE`               | Optional override. Only set it when that exact REES bundle is uploaded. |
| `SENTRY_URL`                   | Optional Sentry API URL; defaults to `https://sentry.io`.               |
| `SENTRY_REPOSITORY`            | Optional; defaults to `JSONbored/gittensory` for commit association.    |
| `REES_SENTRY_UPLOAD_STRICT`    | Optional. Set `true` to fail startup if source-map upload fails.        |
| `REES_SENTRY_VALIDATE_RELEASE` | Optional. Set `false` only to disable post-upload release validation.   |

By default the release id is `gittensory-rees@<RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA>`, using Railway's Git metadata. The Sentry
GitHub code mapping should be:

| Sentry field     | Value               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Stack Trace Root | `/app`              |
| Source Code Root | `review-enrichment` |
| Branch           | `main`              |

Do **not** pass `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` as a Docker build arg. Railway deploys this service from Git, and Docker build args
can leak through image metadata. Keeping the upload at runtime means Sentry sees the same `dist/` files that the service
executes, without exposing source maps over HTTP.

After upload, startup validates the exact `gittensory-rees@<RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA>` release through the Sentry API:
the release must exist, be finalized, include the deployed commit, and include the Railway deploy id/environment. If
`REES_SENTRY_UPLOAD_STRICT=true`, a failed upload or failed validation stops the Railway deployment; otherwise it logs a
`rees_sentry_sourcemap_upload_failed` warning so the problem is visible without blocking startup.

Analyzer failures are still fail-open: the `/v1/enrich` response marks the analyzer as `degraded` and returns a partial
brief. When Sentry is enabled, those degradations are captured as `rees_analyzer_degraded` events with tags/context for
`analyzer`, requested analyzer list, `repo`, `pullNumber`, head SHA prefix, `release`, `environment`, timeout budget,
elapsed time, partial/analyzer status, history lookup counts, GitHub endpoint category, request id, and trace id. Use
those fields to spot a broken analyzer without exposing request bodies, diffs, tokens, prompts, comments, or private
config.

### REES Sentry queries

REES keeps its indexed Sentry tags intentionally small and stable:

- `event`
- `route`
- `method`
- `repo`
- `pullNumber`
- `analyzer`
- `release`
- `environment`
- `railwayDeploymentId`

Useful production queries:

- Route exceptions on the enrichment endpoint:
  - `event:rees_route_error route:/v1/enrich method:POST`
- Analyzer failures grouped by analyzer:
  - `event:rees_analyzer_degraded analyzer:history`
  - `event:rees_analyzer_degraded analyzer:dependency repo:JSONbored/gittensory`
- Source-map upload/startup failures on a Railway deploy:
  - `event:rees_sourcemap_upload_failed railwayDeploymentId:<deploy-id>`
- Process-level crashes:
  - `event:rees_uncaught_exception`
  - `event:rees_unhandled_rejection`

If Sentry still shows frames such as `/app/dist/server.js`, check:

1. The event's `release` is `gittensory-rees@<same Railway commit sha>` or your exact `SENTRY_RELEASE` override.
2. The Sentry release has an artifact bundle uploaded for the REES project.
3. Railway has `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, and `SENTRY_PROJECT` set on the REES service.
4. Startup logs include `sentry_release_validation_complete` for the same release id and Railway deployment id.
5. The Sentry code mapping is `/app` → `review-enrichment` on branch `main`.
6. `npm --prefix review-enrichment run validate:sourcemaps` passes locally.
