// Gittensory AI maintainer review (the `aiReview` capability).
//
// Two layers, both opt-in and both fail-safe (no AI / errors / over-budget / unsafe output → no public
// text and no gate finding; gittensory NEVER blocks because the model spoke):
//
//   • Advisory notes — a concise maintainer-style write-up (assessment + suggestions + risks). When the
//     repo has BYOK configured, the maintainer's own frontier model (Anthropic/OpenAI) writes it;
//     otherwise the configured free/default reviewer does (self-host: the AI_PROVIDER chain — Codex
//     primary, Claude Code fallback, etc; unconfigured/hosted: the legacy Workers-AI pair below).
//     Advisory only — never blocks.
//   • Consensus defect — a conservative gate signal. The configured reviewer PAIR each independently
//     reviews the diff; a defect is reported ONLY when BOTH models flag a high-confidence critical defect
//     (bug / security / data-loss / build break). BYOK never changes this path, so it never changes who
//     can be blocked. The resulting finding is honored by the gate only in `block` mode AND only for
//     confirmed Gittensor contributors (the gate enforces that downstream).
//
// Every public string (notes + defect title/detail) is forced through `sanitizePublicComment`; anything
// that trips the public/private boundary is dropped, not published. Free/default-reviewer calls are metered
// against the shared daily neuron budget; maintainer-paid BYOK calls have a separate repo/day cap. All calls
// are audited via `recordAiUsageEvent` (with real provider/token/cost usage when the configured provider
// reports it, per migration 0109 — see `coerceAiUsage`/`aggregateActualUsage`).
