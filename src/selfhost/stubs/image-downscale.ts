// Self-host replacement for src/review/visual/image-downscale.ts (#4370). Swapped in by
// scripts/build-selfhost.mjs's esbuild plugin, the same mechanism used for @cloudflare/puppeteer and
// ./pixel-diff — this file is only ever bundled into dist/server.mjs, never the Worker entry, so it's safe
// to depend on sharp (a native binding) here. Unlike puppeteer-core, sharp is marked `external` in the
// --all esbuild bundle (a native binding can't be bundled) and installed separately into the runtime Docker
// image (see the Dockerfile) rather than lazily imported at call time — sharp has no browser-sidecar-style
// opt-in the way puppeteer-core does, so a plain static import is fine.
