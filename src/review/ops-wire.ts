// Convergence (ops / observability) — wires the ported alerts + stats observability into gittensory, behind
// the default-OFF `GITTENSORY_REVIEW_OPS` flag. Flag-OFF every export here is a no-op / 404, so the worker is
// byte-identical to today (the cron enqueues no ops job; the endpoint short-circuits).
//
// ADAPTED TO GITTENSORY'S OWN OUTCOME DATA — NOT reviewbot's `review_targets`/`review_audit` (those tables are
// not populated here). The ported reviewbot modules (src/review/alerts.ts, src/review/stats.ts) are built
// around `review_targets` + a Discord webhook; gittensory's review-outcome ledger is different, so this module
// derives the equivalent health/anomaly signals from gittensory's native sources via the EXISTING aggregation
// services (no new queries, no schema change):
//   • gate_outcomes (#554) — the gate-block ledger; blocked-then-merged = a gate FALSE POSITIVE, plus the
//     maintainer-OVERRIDE count. Aggregated by services/gate-precision.ts (buildGatePrecisionReport).
//   • agent_recommendation_outcomes (#543) — recommendation positive/negative/pending split, and the
//     persisted slop band on resolved PRs (slop score discrimination). Aggregated by
//     services/outcome-calibration.ts (buildRepoOutcomeCalibration).
//
// NOTIFY PATH: gittensory has NO Discord / operator webhook (notifications/service.ts is a per-recipient,
// pull-based BADGE feed — the wrong channel for an operator anomaly). So an anomaly emits a structured
// `console.error` log line with an `event` field (#orb-ci-stuck-repeat: this was previously `console.warn` with
// an `ev` field — forwardStructuredLogToSentry, src/selfhost/sentry.ts, only wraps console.log/console.error
// -- never console.warn -- and keys the Sentry issue off a field literally named `event`, not `ev`. Under the
// old shape, every anomaly this module ever found was invisible to Sentry regardless of whether Sentry was
// active; it only ever reached Workers Logs, which is why a 20+-hour token-usage bleed went unnoticed until a
// human queried the database directly. `console.error` + `event` is the same convention every other Sentry-
// visible anomaly signal in this codebase already uses (selfhost_ai_provider_failed, regate_repair_exhausted,
// ci_stuck_review_repeat_suppressed).
//
// DEFERRED (NOT implemented here): the auto-tune / auto-apply config-mutation self-improve loop. The ported
// pure logic + D1 store already exist in src/review/auto-apply.ts, but actually CLOSING the loop (mutating a
// live gate's tunables from the cron) is sensitive — it needs the `tunables_overrides` / `_shadow` /
// `override_audit` D1 tables (none of which exist in gittensory's migrations yet) plus a careful soak/promote
// design. This module is READ-ONLY observability: it reports drift; it never changes what blocks a live PR.
