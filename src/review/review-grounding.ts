// SINGLE modular home for review GROUNDING (#review-grounding). Feeds the AI reviewer the FINISHED CI
// results + the FULL post-change content of the changed files, so a non-frontier model stops hallucinating
// CI outcomes ("this will break CI" on a green PR) and undefined symbols ("X is not defined" when it's
// defined 10 lines outside the visible hunk) — the #967 class of false blockers.
//
// Every review lane calls these helpers; ACTIVATION is a single `features.grounding` ConvergedFeatureKey
// (resolved via resolveConvergedFeature / convergedFeatureActive) plus the LOOPOVER_REVIEW_GROUNDING env
// kill-switch (default OFF). `ciGrounding` / `fullFileContext` below are internal GroundingFlags fields —
// today's one real caller (groundingFlags() in ./grounding-wire) always sets both identically; they are
// not independently-settable `.loopover.yml` keys. Fully fail-safe: any fetch error degrades to "no
// grounding" and the review proceeds on the diff alone.
//
// SELF-CONTAINED NATIVE PORT (reviewbot→loopover convergence): every type + helper this module needs is
// defined HERE. No imports from reviewbot. The logic is byte-faithful to the reviewbot source
// (src/core/review-grounding.ts); the only deltas are (1) mechanical guards for loopover's stricter
// tsconfig (noUncheckedIndexedAccess + exactOptionalPropertyTypes), which do not change behavior, and
// (2) the one I/O dependency (GitHub file fetch) is INJECTED via the FileFetcher interface + explicit
// params instead of reviewbot's RunContext/ReviewTarget/github helpers, so fetchFullFileContents is
// self-contained and unit-testable. The host wires a real GitHub-backed FileFetcher at the call site.
