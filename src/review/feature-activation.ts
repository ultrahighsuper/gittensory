// Shared per-PR advisory-feature activation resolver (#4616, generalizing the phase-2 per-repo migration this
// file originally shipped for just the `features:`-block keys).
//
// Before this file existed, each feature ran when `isXEnabled(env)` (a global env flag) AND
// `isConvergenceRepoAllowed(env, repo)` (the LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS allowlist) were both true — coarse,
// all-or-nothing per repo, configured only via env. `resolveConvergedFeature` replaced that for the six
// `features:`-block keys (now seven, see below) with a per-repo `.loopover.yml` override. But that migration
// left ~10 OTHER per-PR advisory capabilities (screenshots, impactMap, reviewMemory, cultureProfile,
// inlineComments, fixHandoff, …) each re-implementing their OWN hand-rolled version of the same boolean
// arithmetic outside this file, with at least four subtly different precedence shapes and no single place
// documenting which feature uses which (#4616's config-sprawl audit finding — already the root cause of one
// production incident, see LOOPOVER_PUBLIC_STATS_REPOS's doc comment in env.d.ts).
//
// `resolveFeatureActivation` below is now the ONE pure core every one of those precedence shapes reduces to.
// `resolveConvergedFeature` and `resolveManifestOnlyFeature` are the two thin adapters over it in actual use:
//   - `resolveConvergedFeature` — the `features:`-block keys (rag/reputation/safety/grounding/
//     e2eTests/screenshots): env kill-switch → per-repo `features:` override → `LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS`
//     allowlist default. Safety, grounding, and screenshots are the named exceptions this shape has; see
//     `FEATURE_MODE` below.
//   - `resolveManifestOnlyFeature` — the `review:`-block keys with NO allowlist role at all (impactMap /
//     reviewMemory / cultureProfile / inlineComments / fixHandoff): env kill-switch → an EXPLICIT per-repo
//     `review.*` opt-in is the only way to activate. These live under a different `.loopover.yml` namespace
//     (`review:`, not `features:`) than the seven `ConvergedFeatureKey`s above, so they were never candidates
//     for literally becoming `ConvergedFeatureKey`s — renaming an operator's existing yml key would itself be a
//     behavior break — but they share the exact same underlying arithmetic as "standard" mode with the
//     allowlist input pinned to `false` (a `manifestOnly` feature can never be force-activated by
//     LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS the way its `features:`-block cousins can).
//
// `convergedFeatureActive` is the async convenience that loads the cached focus manifest itself for
// `resolveConvergedFeature`'s callers that don't already hold one.

/**
 * The four per-feature activation precedence shapes actually in use across loopover's advisory review
 * capabilities (#4616):
 *  - `"standard"`: `override` fully controls (`true` forces on, `false` forces off); `null` (unset) falls back
 *    to `allowlisted`. rag / reputation / e2eTests / improvementSignal.
 *  - `"forceOnOnly"`: `override` can only force ON (bypassing the allowlist); an untrusted `false` is "no
 *    opinion" and falls through to `allowlisted` — for a feature where a lower-trust, repo-controlled override
 *    must never be able to silently defeat the operator's own enablement. safety (#2269).
 *  - `"allowlistRequired"`: `allowlisted` is a hard requirement regardless of `override`; an override may
 *    ADDITIONALLY force OFF within an allowlisted repo, never force ON outside it. grounding (fetches full
 *    post-change file contents for the AI prompt) and screenshots (launches browser rendering and stores
 *    publicly embedded images), so a repo override alone must never bypass the operator's own allowlist.
 *  - `"manifestOnly"`: there is no allowlist role at all (`allowlisted` is never consulted); an explicit
 *    `override === true` is the ONLY way to activate. impactMap / reviewMemory / cultureProfile /
 *    inlineComments / fixHandoff — each shipped as an explicit-opt-in-only `.loopover.yml` `review.*` toggle
 *    from day one, with no `LOOPOVER_REVIEW_REPOS` role ever defined for it (see
 *    {@link resolveManifestOnlyFeature}).
