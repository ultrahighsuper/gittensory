// blockers; see that module's header for the full reasoning.

 * `rules/advisory.ts`'s `isConfiguredGateBlocker` treats as an unconditional hard blocker — the weak
 * `seed_or_mnemonic` / `bittensor_key` heuristics are ignored entirely here because they false-positive on
 * legitimate config/workflow content (e.g. `coldkey:` / `hotkey =` lines in *.toml, .github/workflows/**, or

 * is a leak on any repo, so the caller runs it regardless of the safety flag / review allowlist (unlike the
 * prompt-injection defang, which stays flag-gated).
 *
 * `ADVISORY_ONLY_SECRET_KINDS` (currently just `generic_secret_assignment`) is a keyword-plus-quoted-value
 * SHAPE heuristic, not a concrete format — see `secret-patterns.ts`'s `HARD_SECRET_KINDS` doc comment for why
 * it was split out (PR #5346 auto-closed a legitimate contributor PR on two inert test-fixture strings). A
 * hit on ONLY this kind (no concrete kind present) instead returns a warning-severity `possible_secret_
 * assignment` finding, which `isConfiguredGateBlocker` does not recognize as a blocker code — it surfaces in
 * the PR panel for a human/AI reviewer to verify, exactly as REES's own "medium confidence" rating for this
 * same signal already treats it, without risking another auto-close false positive.
 *
 * #3041: scans the RAW diff directly — `scanDiffForSecretsWithLocations` does its own +/- line-type
 * distinguishing (only added lines and added/renamed file paths are scanned, matching the previous
 * added-only-text behavior) while also tracking each hit's file:line, so the finding can point a maintainer
 * straight at the flagged content instead of forcing them to re-derive it from the whole diff.
