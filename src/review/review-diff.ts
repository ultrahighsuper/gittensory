// Bounded, source-first, hunk-aware unified-diff builder for the AI reviewers.
// Ported from reviewbot (the source-of-truth engine, src/core/diff.ts). The previous gittensory builder
// was a blind head-slice that `break`-DROPPED whole files on overflow with no priority ordering — so on a
// multi-file PR the file that DEFINES a symbol could be dropped while another file references it, and the
// model then hallucinated "missing import / undefined symbol" (the metagraphed #1528 false-positive class,
// which survived even with full-file grounding on). This builder orders source-first, reduces oversized
// patches hunk-aware instead of dropping them, and always lists patch-less/over-budget files. (#accuracy-gap-1)
