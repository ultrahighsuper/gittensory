// Convergence (reputation) wiring: feeds the ported, INTERNAL-only submitter-reputation signal

// AI-spend gate. A new / burst / low-reputation submitter is downgraded to a DETERMINISTIC-ONLY review
// (the AI neurons are skipped); a good-reputation submitter proceeds normally. After the gate decides, the
// terminal outcome is recorded so the signal stays current.
//
// Single env switch: GITTENSORY_REVIEW_REPUTATION. Default OFF (unset/"false") — when OFF every helper here is an
// immediate no-op: no reputation is read, nothing is recorded, and the AI-spend gate takes no new branch, so
// the path is byte-identical to today. Truthy follows the codebase convention (`/^(1|true|yes|on)$/i`, same
// as isSafetyEnabled / isGroundingEnabled / isEnabled).
//
// STRICTLY INTERNAL: the reputation NEVER appears in any public comment, label, or check-run. It only routes
// the AI-spend decision (private, server-side) and writes the private submitter_stats table. Fully fail-safe:
// the ported module degrades to "neutral" / no-op on any DB error, so this never throws into the gate.
