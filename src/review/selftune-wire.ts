// Convergence (#self-improve) — wires the ported self-improvement loop (src/review/auto-tune.ts +
// src/review/auto-apply.ts) into gittensory's cron behind the default-OFF `GITTENSORY_REVIEW_SELFTUNE` flag.
//
// SAFETY CONTRACT (must hold under every path):
//   • flag-OFF (default) → the cron enqueues NO selftune job and this module is never reached; ZERO tuning
//     work, NO override read/written, the worker is byte-identical to today.
//   • flag-ON → the loop can ONLY EVER TIGHTEN the gate. It computes tuning recommendations from gittensory's
//     OWN outcome data, SHADOW-SOAKS only STRICTLY-TIGHTENING recommendations, and AUTO-PROMOTES a soaked
//     shadow override to live ONLY after the soak window passes the gate (tightening + evidence + soaked).
//     Every action is recorded to override_audit. A loosening change is NEVER applied — the ported
//     `isStrictlyTightening` / `evaluateShadowPromotion` reject it, and the eval mapping below NEVER feeds a
//     loosening directive into the apply path (closeFalse is held at 0, so the one loosening branch of
//     `computeTuningRecommendations` is unreachable and carries no payload anyway).
//
// EVAL INPUT — ADAPTED TO GITTENSORY'S OWN OUTCOME DATA (NOT reviewbot's review_audit, which does not exist in
// gittensory's migrations — parity.computeGateEval would read an empty table here). The ported auto-tune
// advisor consumes a GateEvalReport (per-project confusion matrix). We build that report from gittensory's
// NATIVE outcome sources via the SAME aggregation services ops-wire already reuses (no new queries / schema):
//   • agent_recommendation_outcomes (#543) — the positive/negative resolved split (buildRepoOutcomeCalibration).
//     Only maintainer-lane outcomes are authoritative enough for live self-tune policy changes; contributor-lane
//     closures can be self-authored and stay reporting-only. A maintainer-lane NEGATIVE outcome (gittensory
//     recommended "proceed", the human CLOSED) is the gittensory-native analogue of reviewbot's "would-merge
//     BUT human closed" (mergeFalse) — the dangerous error a TIGHTENING fixes.
// The mapping is deliberately conservative: it only ever populates the would-MERGE side of the matrix, so the
// advisor can only ever recommend a TIGHTENING (raise the floor) or a no-op — never a loosening.
//
// CONFIG-APPLICATION — WIRED (live read-back, tightening-only):
//   The ported override model is `confidenceFloor` (a proceed-confidence floor in [0,1]) + `scopeCap`. The live
//   read-back lives in resolveRepositorySettings → `applySelfTuneOverrideToSettings`, gated by the SAME default-OFF
//   GITTENSORY_REVIEW_SELFTUNE flag: it translates a promoted `confidenceFloor` into gittensory's NATIVE readiness
//   tunable by RAISING an EXISTING `qualityGateMinScore` to `round(confidenceFloor * 100)` via a `max()`. By
//   construction this can ONLY tighten — it never CREATES a readiness gate the operator didn't set, and never
//   LOWERS one — so the always-tightening recommendation (this module only ever populates the would-merge error
//   side, so the advisor can only raise the floor) reaches the live gate with no risk of loosening it. Flag-OFF
//   (default) the override is never read and settings are byte-identical. (See applySelfTuneOverrideToSettings.)
