// Repo quality-culture profile wiring (#2995): feeds the AI reviewer a compact, additive grounding block
// derived from the repo's OWN merge history (typical PR size, common accepted labels) so a verdict reads as
// grounded in how THIS repo actually operates, instead of generic boilerplate. Exactly the same shape/seam as
// `./rag-wire.ts` (retrieval) and `./grounding-wire.ts` (CI/file grounding): a thin HOST adapter over the
// self-contained, fixture-testable extractor (`./repo-culture-profile.ts`), splicing a pre-formatted block into
// the reviewer's USER prompt as reference context only.
//
// Two independent switches, same precedence as every other converged review knob in this codebase (see
// `review/feature-activation.ts`'s doc comment): a GLOBAL env kill-switch (GITTENSORY_REVIEW_CULTURE_PROFILE,
// default OFF) gates whether the capability exists AT ALL, and the per-repo `.gittensory.yml`
// `review.culture_profile` boolean (see signals/focus-manifest.ts) opts a specific repo in once the global
// switch is on. Both default OFF/absent ⇒ this module is never invoked, no D1 read happens, and the reviewer
// prompt is byte-identical to today. `shouldApplyRepoCultureProfile` is the "manifestOnly" precedence shape
// (#4616) — see `resolveManifestOnlyFeature`/`FeatureActivationMode` in `./feature-activation` for the shared
// core this, and four sibling `review:`-block features, now delegate to.
//
// ADVISORY GROUNDING ONLY (house rule + #2995 requirement): this NEVER becomes a gate/scoring input. It only
// ever appends a reference-only block to the AI reviewer's USER prompt, exactly like the RAG/grounding/
// enrichment sections it sits alongside in `services/ai-review.ts`'s buildUserPrompt.
