// Deterministic surface-model review orchestrator (no AI — surfaces are structured data; gittensory is the
// sole adjudicator). Given a lane spec, the PR's changed files, and an injected file-content loader, it:
//   1. classifies the PR via classifyRegistryPrScope (entry / provider / not-a-direct-submission),
//   2. loads the head (+ base, for entries) document content,
//   3. resolves the appended surfaces[] entries by diffing head vs base, capped at the spec's maxAppendedEntries
//      (omitted ⇒ today's strict single-entry-only default),
//   4. rejects a duplicate appended entry when the spec opts into duplicateKeyFields (omitted ⇒ off), and
//   5. validates EACH remaining appended entry independently via the spec's OWN assessAppendedEntry /
//      assessProviderEntry validators (the orchestrator never hardcodes a domain-specific validator — a spec
//      with no validator configured gets "manual") and returns one aggregate verdict: close if any entry is
//      invalid, manual if any (remaining) needs manual review, merge only when every entry is clean, and
//   6. for an entry submission riding alongside a path-shaped provider companion file, confirms the companion is
//      actually a DEBUT (absent at base — an edit to an already-registered provider routes to manual instead),
//      then validates it via assessProviderEntry and combines it with the entry's own result — merge only when
//      BOTH sides are clean.
// Pure + injectable: unit tests pass a loadFile stub, so no network. The live wiring (a per-repo,
// flag-gated branch in the review body) is a separate follow-up.
