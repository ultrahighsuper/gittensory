// src/review/content-lane/security-scan.ts (content-lane hard-block, for awesome-claude/metagraphed
// submissions) — both live under src/, ship in the same build/deploy, and had no deploy-independence reason
// to be hand-duplicated. That duplication already caused two independent, currently-live drifts (missing
// mock carve-out + missing voyage/firecrawl kinds, see #4604) despite a same-day commit (3307ae097, #4587)
// editing both copies for one change — there was no automated pairing between the two files.
//
// review-enrichment/src/analyzers/secret-scan.ts (REES) is deliberately NOT imported here and stays a
// genuinely separate, wider copy: REES deploys standalone on Railway with its own tsconfig/build/test
// pipeline, so importing across that boundary would break its independence (the same reasoning
// secrets-scan.ts's own header documents for staying self-contained relative to reviewbot). REES's
// isPlaceholderSecretValue body and the kind names it shares with HARD_SECRET_KINDS below are instead
// drift-checked mechanically — see scripts/check-engine-parity.ts's SECRET_DETECTION_TWIN_PAIR.
