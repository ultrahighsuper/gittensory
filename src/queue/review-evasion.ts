/** Review-evasion protection (#review-evasion-protection, broadened #self-close-post-review): a CONTRIBUTOR
 *  closing their OWN PR after loopover has run a review pass against its current headSha is dodging the
 *  one-shot review, not making an ordinary close. GitHub lets a contributor reopen a PR they closed
 *  themselves but NOT one closed by a maintainer or the App (#one-shot-reopen) -- so this reopens the PR (as
 *  the App) and immediately re-closes it (as the App), converting the contributor's own close into an
 *  App-authored, terminal one they cannot reopen; any later reopen attempt is caught by the EXISTING
 *  maybeRecloseDisallowedReopen guard above. Uses hasReviewedForHeadSha (not hasActiveReviewForHeadSha)
 *  deliberately, mirroring the draft-conversion sibling below: the active-only window closes the instant a
 *  review publishes, but a human reacting to a now-VISIBLE label/comment necessarily acts AFTER that -- the
 *  narrow window could only ever catch someone self-closing blind. Unlike the draft-conversion sibling, this
 *  guard's own enforcement action closes the PR again -- so a redelivered/retried webhook for the SAME
 *  original close must not re-run the reopen/close dance; a live-timeline closer check (mirrors
 *  recloseDisallowedReopenIfNeeded's own pattern) distinguishes that from a genuinely fresh self-close.
 *  `.loopover.yml` settings.autoCloseExemptLogins (the same shared allowlist the draft-conversion/
 *  contributor-cap/review-nag guards already honor) is an explicit escape hatch for trusted contributors.
 *  Per-PR actuation-locked like its draft-dodge/reopen-reclose siblings. The strike only counts once the

/** Draft-PR close policy (#draft-pr-close-policy): distinct from the four review-evasion guards above, which
 *  all key off a review having ALREADY run (an active pass, a prior recorded gate failure, or a repeated
 *  2nd+ cycle) -- this guard enforces on ANY draft, including the very first one, opened directly as a draft
 *  or converted to draft before a review has had any chance to run at all. The abuse pattern this closes is a
 *  contributor farming bot labels/AI-review/CI feedback from a PR that never reaches a real one-shot
 *  disposition. Off by default (`settings.draftPrClosePolicy !== "close"` bails immediately) -- unlike
 *  reviewEvasionProtection's default-close, this is opt-in: it can catch ordinary, legitimate WIP-signaling
 *  contributors who simply open (or convert to) a draft with no abusive intent, so a maintainer chooses it
 *  deliberately for a specific repo rather than getting it for free. Deliberately does NOT record a
 *  moderation strike (unlike the review-evasion siblings) -- this is a blanket repo policy applied to
 *  ordinary GitHub draft usage, not a detected abuse pattern, so it would be unfair to count it toward a
 *  contributor's ban threshold. Only the PR's OWN author opening/converting their OWN PR to draft is a
 *  candidate (mirrors the review-evasion siblings' identical actor check) -- a maintainer opening a draft on
 *  a contributor's behalf, or converting someone else's PR to draft, is an ordinary maintainer action.
 *  Per-PR actuation-locked like its siblings. */
