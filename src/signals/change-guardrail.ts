// Convergence safety: the hard-guardrail path check for the auto-maintain layer (#778). Changed paths that

// that touches a guarded path (scoring / auth / CI workflows / policy scripts, etc.). Ported verbatim from
// reviewbot core/change-classifier.ts — the mechanism that prevents the awesome-claude #4196 incident class
// (a weakened policy script auto-merging because its path wasn't guarded). Pure + dependency-free.

// Canonicalize a path or glob so matching is case- and separator-insensitive: backslashes → `/`, drop a
// leading `./` or `/`, and case-fold. Mirrors signals/focus-manifest `normalizePathForMatch` — without it a
// guarded path is evaded with `.github/Workflows/` (capital W), a `./`-prefix, or a `\` separator, turning a
// mandatory human hold on CI/policy files into an auto-merge.

// globToRegExp's COMPILATION is linear-time, but the COMPILED pattern's .test() can be polynomial-to-exponential
// time on an adversarial near-miss input when MULTIPLE wildcard GROUPS chain in one glob (a "group" is one `*`
// OR one `**` — a `**` pair compiles to a SINGLE `.*`, not two independent wildcards, so it must be counted as
// ONE group, not two characters; see countWildcardGroups below). Both group TYPES contribute to the same danger
// once chained — `[^/]*` groups separated by a literal that class doesn't exclude (e.g. "-", not "/") back-
// track ambiguously, and `.*` groups back-track ambiguously EVEN when "/"-separated, since `.*` crosses `/`
// freely. Re-benchmarked against `path` lengths GitHub can plausibly deliver via a deeply nested file path in a
// malicious PR (both `path` and, via `.gittensory.yml`'s contentLane.*Glob fields, the glob itself can be
// attacker-influenced in the same PR):
//   2 wildcard groups (any mix of `*`/`**`, any arrangement): sub-second even at a wildly implausible 32,000-
//                       char adversarial path (worst case observed: ~400ms) — quadratic, bounded, never a
//                       realistic hang.
//   3 wildcard groups: OVER 2 SECONDS at just ~4,000 chars for one chained-`*` shape, over 100ms at ~1,600
//                       chars for a chained-`**` shape — already dangerous well within a plausible path length.
//   4+ wildcard groups: confirmed catastrophic — 35 SECONDS at just 1,614 chars for 4 chained `**` groups.
// hardGuardrailGlobs today are 100% hardcoded engine constants (see review/guardrail-config.ts) — no
// maintainer/contributor input reaches globToRegExp via that path today, and none of those real globs exceed 1
// wildcard group — but it is also exported for reuse by other maintainer-config-driven consumers
// (content-lane/spec-resolver.ts, whose real globs like "public/**/*.json" are exactly 2 groups: this cap must
// stay inclusive of that legitimate shape, not just "safer than before"), so the cap lives INSIDE globToRegExp
// itself (not just in a wrapper like matchesAny below) — every caller, present or future, direct or indirect, is
// protected automatically rather than needing to separately remember the risk. The boundary is set at the
// highest GROUP count proven safe by the benchmark above (2) — a boundary that itself sits inside the
// empirically dangerous range would defeat the point of a cap.
