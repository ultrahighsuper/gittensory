 * path it posts a comment PROMISING closure — silently downgrading it to a hold while a comment promises closure
 * would be incoherent. So a plan whose only close is the deterministic one is returned UNCHANGED. A plan with a
 * heuristic close gets it dropped; a deterministic close present alongside is KEPT.
 *
 * It ALSO exempts a heuristic close carrying `closeConcreteEvidence: true` (red CI, a base conflict, a
 * committed secret, a deterministic duplicate, or another code in {@link CONCRETE_EVIDENCE_BLOCKER_CODES}):
 * the breaker exists to catch a heuristic call that turned out to be WRONG, and concrete evidence is not the
 * class of error it is watching for. A heuristic close with no concrete evidence (an unconfirmed AI verdict,
 * a bare gate-verdict=failure, or a slop-score threshold) stays fully subject to the breaker.
 *
 * The existing changes-requested label is KEPT (it correctly says the PR is not mergeable). PURE + idempotent:
 * with `closeHoldOnly` false this returns the plan UNCHANGED (the common path); with no downgradable close
 * planned it is also a no-op. Only ever makes the system MORE cautious.
