# Self-host private config — layout, precedence, and examples

This directory ships **generic, safe** examples for the self-host **private** config directory
(`GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR`, default `/config` in the Docker image / `docker-compose.yml`). It
contains no real policy, thresholds, logins, or repo names — copy what you need into your own
mounted config directory and edit it there (never in this repo).

See **[TEMPLATES.md](./TEMPLATES.md)** for the full template catalog (minimal + exhaustive
`gittensory.yml` starters, public-vs-private usage, and fleet notes for `gittensory`,
`awesome-claude`, and `metagraphed` without committing private policy).

The private config directory is read by `src/selfhost/private-config.ts` and is kept **out of the
public GitHub repo** on purpose: contributors can read a public `.gittensory.yml`, so anti-abuse
thresholds, maintainer/admin allowlists, autonomy dials, and model/effort settings belong here
instead, where only the self-host operator can see them.

## Directory layout

For a repo `owner/repo`, the reader tries, in priority order:

```
${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/owner__repo/.gittensory.yml   # 1. owner-qualified folder (recommended)
${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/repo/.gittensory.yml          # 2. bare repo-name folder
${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/owner__repo.yml               # 3. flat file (back-compat)
${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/.gittensory.yml               # 4. global default, shared by every repo
${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/_shared/.gittensory.yml       # 5. shared base (#1959), lowest priority
```

`.yaml` and `.json` are accepted everywhere `.yml` is. Every one of these files uses the **exact
same schema** as the public `.gittensory.yml` — see [`gittensory.full.yml`](./gittensory.full.yml)
(or [`.gittensory.yml.example`](../../.gittensory.yml.example) at the repo root) for the exhaustive,
field-by-field reference. For the smallest safe starter, copy [`gittensory.minimal.yml`](./gittensory.minimal.yml)
(or [`.gittensory.minimal.yml`](../../.gittensory.minimal.yml)) to your repo root as `.gittensory.yml`
or into your private mount and customize from there.

## Precedence chain

From highest to lowest priority:

1. **Private per-repo file**, deep-merged over **2** and **3** when more than one exists (see
   below) — or used alone when it is the only private layer present.
2. **Private global default** (`${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/.gittensory.yml`) — deep-merged
   under **1** when both exist; used alone when a repo has no per-repo file of its own and no
   shared base is mounted.
3. **Private shared base** (`${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/_shared/.gittensory.yml`, #1959) — the
   lowest-priority private layer, deep-merged under both **1** and **2**. An operator running many
   repos writes a house review policy (e.g. a default `review.tone`, `path_filters`, or
   `exclude_paths`) here **once** instead of copy-pasting it into every repo's per-repo file or
   the global default. `.yaml`/`.json` are accepted, same as every other candidate. Absent (the
   default, common case) ⇒ byte-identical behavior to the pre-#1959 2-layer chain.
4. When **none** of the three private layers above exists, the loader falls back to the **public
   repo `.gittensory.yml`** (or `.github/gittensory.yml`) fetched from GitHub.
5. **Dashboard/API-stored settings** for the repo.
6. **Built-in safe defaults.**

Layers 1-3 are evaluated together as one private-config layer: if *any* of a per-repo file, a
global default, or a shared base exists privately, the public file in layer 4 is **never
consulted** for that repo. This is unchanged from the original private-config behavior (#1390) —
only the interaction *among* the three private layers is new (the per-repo/global interaction
shipped first; the shared base is the newest, lowest layer, #1959).

This chain governs *per-repo review policy* only. A separate, lower-level set of **deployment
environment variables** (`GITTENSORY_REVIEW_*` flags, AI provider keys/models, self-host runtime
knobs, etc.) configures the deployment itself and sits **underneath** all 5 layers above — a
`.gittensory.yml`/private-config value never overrides an operator's env-level kill-switch, it only
narrows what's already permitted. See the generated, always-current
[`SELFHOST_ENV_REFERENCE_ROWS`](../../apps/gittensory-ui/src/lib/selfhost-env-reference.ts) (built by
`npm run selfhost:env-reference` from every `env.SOMETHING` read in the codebase) for the full list.

## Overlay (deep-merge) semantics

When **two or more** of {a per-repo file, a global default, a shared base} exist for a repo, they
are merged in ascending priority — shared base first, global default overlaid on top of that, then
the per-repo file overlaid on top of that (see [Shared base layer](#shared-base-layer-multi-repo-operators-1959)
below for the shared base specifically):

- **Nested mappings** (`gate`, `settings`, `review`, `features`, `contentLane`, and their own
  nested blocks like `gate.readiness` or `gate.aiReview`) merge **key by key**. A higher-priority
  file only needs to mention the keys it wants to change; everything else is inherited from the
  next layer down.
- **Arrays** (`wantedPaths`, `preferredLabels`, `testExpectations`,
  `review.pathInstructions`, `review.excludePaths`, `contentLane.duplicateKeyFields`, etc.)
  **replace wholesale** — a higher-priority array is never concatenated with a lower layer's.
- An **explicit `null`** at a key in a higher-priority file always overrides a lower layer's value
  there. This clears a setting wherever the manifest parser already treats an explicit `null` as
  "off"/"clear" — e.g. `settings.contributorOpenPrCap`, `settings.contributorOpenIssueCap`,
  `settings.accountAgeThresholdDays`, and the enforcement label names
  (`settings.blacklistLabel`/`contributorCapLabel`/`reviewNagLabel`, see below) — and is a harmless
  no-op (equivalent to omitting the key) everywhere else.
- If any layer fails to parse (or is malformed/oversized), it is dropped from the merge and the
  remaining, still-valid layers merge as if it were never mounted; a still-good layer's policy is
  never silently discarded just because another layer is broken, and a broken layer never blocks a
  review.

### Example 1 — global defaults + a per-repo override

`.gittensory.yml` (global default, at the config dir root):

```yaml
settings:
  contributorOpenPrCap: 3
  autoCloseExemptLogins:
    - your-admin-login
gate:
  enabled: true
  duplicates: block
```

`owner__repo/.gittensory.yml` (per-repo override — only touches what's different for this repo):

```yaml
gate:
  enabled: true
  # duplicates is inherited from global (still "block") — not repeated here.
  aiReview:
    mode: advisory
```

The effective config for `owner/repo` has `gate.duplicates: block` (from global),
`gate.aiReview.mode: advisory` and `gate.enabled: true` (from the per-repo file), and
`settings.contributorOpenPrCap: 3` plus the exempt login (both from global).

### Example 2 — disabling a global setting for one high-trust repo

```yaml
# owner__repo/.gittensory.yml
settings:
  contributorOpenPrCap: null   # explicitly clears the global cap of 3 for this repo only
```

### Example 3 — an admin/maintainer exemption list

Shared anti-abuse mechanisms (the review-request-nag cooldown, the contributor open-item cap)
exempt configured logins on top of the standing owner/admin/automation-bot exemption:

```yaml
# .gittensory.yml (global default)
settings:
  autoCloseExemptLogins:
    - your-trusted-regular
```

## Shared base layer (multi-repo operators, #1959)

An operator running **many** repos through the same self-host instance can express one house
review policy — e.g. a default `review.tone`, a baseline `path_filters`/`wantedPaths` set, or
common `exclude_paths` — **once**, instead of copy-pasting it into every repo's per-repo file or
even the global default. That policy lives at:

```
${GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR}/_shared/.gittensory.yml
```

(`.yaml`/`.json` also accepted, same lookup order as every other candidate — see
[`shared.gittensory.yml`](./shared.gittensory.yml) for a starter). It sits at the **lowest**
priority of the three private layers: a per-repo file overlays a global default, which overlays
the shared base — the shared base fills in only the fields a higher layer is silent on. This is
the exact same deep-merge helper and array-replace/explicit-null-clear semantics described above,
folded across one more layer; it is not a new merge algorithm.

**Absent shared base is the default, common case** — with no `_shared/.gittensory.yml` mounted,
behavior is byte-identical to the pre-#1959 2-layer chain. A malformed or unreadable shared file
fails safe exactly like a malformed per-repo or global file always has: it is dropped from the
merge and the remaining, still-valid layers combine as if it were never mounted — a broken shared
base never blocks a review. When a shared `review:` block contributes, the parsed manifest carries
`review.sharedConfigSource` (runtime provenance only, #2046) with the relative path of the shared
file that supplied the base layer.

### Example 4 — shared base + global default + a per-repo override, all three present

`_shared/.gittensory.yml` (shared base — one house policy for every repo on this instance):

```yaml
review:
  tone: friendly-terse
gate:
  duplicates: block
```

`.gittensory.yml` (global default — this instance's own baseline, silent on `review.tone`):

```yaml
gate:
  enabled: true
```

`owner__repo/.gittensory.yml` (per-repo override — only touches what's different for this repo):

```yaml
gate:
  enabled: true
  # duplicates is inherited from the shared base (still "block") — neither this file nor the
  # global default repeats it.
```

The effective config for `owner/repo` has `review.tone: friendly-terse` (from the shared base;
neither global nor the per-repo file mentions it), `gate.duplicates: block` (from the shared base,
passed through untouched by global), and `gate.enabled: true` (set the same way by both global and
the per-repo file).

## Label autonomy scoping for one-shot review mode

Two `autonomy` classes govern every label the bot can apply, and they are **independent**:

- **`close`** authorizes the terminal merge/close/hold disposition **and** the anti-abuse
  enforcement labels tied to it (blacklist/contributor-cap/review-nag) — a label like
  `over-contributor-limit` is inseparable metadata on its close, so it never needs a separate grant.
  Set `settings.contributorCapLabel`/`blacklistLabel`/`reviewNagLabel` to explicit `null` (not just
  omitted) to close/hold **without** applying any label at all.
- **`review_state_label`** authorizes the bot's own disposition-communication labels only —
  `ready-to-merge` / `changes-requested` / `manual-review` /
  `migration-collision` by default. These are advisory commentary about the bot's own verdict, not
  enforcement, and default OFF like every autonomy class. **For a one-shot review model, leave this
  at the default** so a PR merges, closes, or holds through the required gate check alone — set it
  to `auto` only if you specifically want that commentary as GitHub labels too.

All disposition labels are configurable under `settings.*Label`, and explicit `null` disables the
label without disabling the underlying merge/close/hold decision. Hard path guardrails are
config-as-code only: omitting `settings.hardGuardrailGlobs` or setting it to `[]` means no path
guardrails, and a concrete list replaces any lower-layer private global default.

```yaml
# .gittensory.yml (global default) — recommended one-shot baseline
settings:
  autonomy:
    close: auto
    # review_state_label intentionally omitted (defaults to observe)
```

The broad `autonomy.label` class still exists but no longer gates any of the above — it is not
required for either family and applies to nothing on its own.

## Maintainer-mention nag moderation

`settings.reviewNagMonitoredMentions` extends the `@gittensory`-ping review-nag cooldown
(`reviewNagPolicy`/`reviewNagMaxPings`/`reviewNagCooldownDays`/`reviewNagLabel` — same settings,
one shared policy) to **also** throttle a thread's own author repeatedly @-mentioning a configured
maintainer login, counted independently per login and independently of the `@gittensory` counter:

```yaml
# .gittensory.yml (global default)
settings:
  reviewNagPolicy: hold
  reviewNagMonitoredMentions:
    - your-maintainer-login
```

Owner/admin/automation-bot logins and anyone on `autoCloseExemptLogins` are always exempt, and only
the thread's own author is ever throttled — a third party mentioning the login on someone else's
PR/issue never counts.

## Linked-issue label propagation

`settings.linkedIssueLabelPropagation` copies a label from a linked/closing issue onto the PR when
the issue already carries it — the only mechanism that can ever select a maintainer-reward or
moderation-weighted label; it is never inferred from a PR's title, changed files, AI output, or
existing PR labels. If your labels carry that kind of weight, this is exactly the sort of rule that
belongs in the private layer rather than the public `.gittensory.yml`, so a contributor can see
*that* the mapping exists (via its effect) without being able to read the exact issue-label ->
PR-label rules and game them:

```yaml
# .gittensory.yml (global default)
settings:
  linkedIssueLabelPropagation:
    enabled: true
    mode: exclusive_type_label
    mappings:
      - issueLabel: customer:vip
        prLabel: triage:vip
        removeOtherTypeLabels: false
```

A per-repo override's `mappings` list **replaces** the global default wholesale (the standard
array-replace overlay semantics above) — it does not merge with it.

## What belongs here vs. in the public `.gittensory.yml`

- **Private config** (this directory): anti-abuse thresholds, the contributor cap, maintainer/
  admin exemption logins, autonomy dials, model/effort overrides, and anything else you don't want
  a contributor reading and gaming.
- **Public `.gittensory.yml`** (repo root, contributor-visible): work-area guidance
  (`wantedPaths`), test expectations, and review-panel presentation — nothing here
  should describe your private enforcement strategy.

## Safety

Never commit real policy into this directory or into these example files: no maintainer usernames,
no repo names, no thresholds beyond illustrative placeholders, no secrets or tokens. The two
`.gittensory.yml` files shipped alongside this README are deliberately generic and inert — copy
them into your own mounted `GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR` and edit the copy, not this one.
