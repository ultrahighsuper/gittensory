# and every other query parameter) as its connection argument, instead of re-parsing those pieces
# ourselves. libpq's own URI parser already handles every form it needs to (query-string-only host, as in
# `postgresql:///db?host=/var/run/postgresql`, IPv6 literals, multi-host strings, sslmode, etc.) -- an
# earlier version of this function extracted host/port/dbname manually and discarded the query string
# entirely, silently breaking any URL that relied on it. Sets $PG_SANITIZED_URL (the password-free URI to
# pass to pg_dump) and, if a password was present, a $PGPASSFILE_CREATED wildcard passfile (host/port/
# dbname/user are wildcarded: this file exists only to supply the ONE password for the single connection
# this script makes, and is deleted immediately after via the `cleanup` trap, so there's no scoped value
# in re-deriving the exact host/port/dbname libpq will resolve -- which the query string can override
