      <h2>Queue stuck or dead jobs</h2>
      <p>
        Watch pending, processed, failed, and dead metrics. A high pending count can be webhook
        replay or maintenance work; dead jobs need direct investigation.
      </p>

      <h2>GitHub rate-limit responses or admission deferrals</h2>
      <p>
        Two independent signals cover this:{" "}
        <code>gittensory_github_rest_rate_limit_responses_total</code> counts actual 403/429
        responses from GitHub, and the{" "}
        <code>gittensory_jobs_rate_limit_admission_deferred_total</code> /{" "}
        <code>gittensory_jobs_rate_limit_budget_deferred_total</code> /{" "}
        <code>gittensory_jobs_rate_limited_by_type_total</code> counters track jobs the queue itself
        held back <em>before</em> making a request, to avoid tripping a limit. All three job-side
        counters carry the same three labels — <code>kind</code> (<code>webhook</code> or{" "}
        <code>background</code>), <code>key_scope</code> (<code>installation</code>,{" "}
        <code>public</code>, <code>global</code>, or <code>other</code>), and <code>job_type</code>{" "}
        (the queue job's type, e.g. <code>agent-regate-pr</code>) — so you can break a spike down to
        exactly which token pool and which job type is under pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        A short burst of deferrals is expected and self-resolving: the queue is deliberately trading
        a few seconds of delay to avoid a real 429. Treat it as a real problem only once it&apos;s
        <strong> sustained</strong> — which is exactly what{" "}
        <code>GittensoryGitHubRateLimitResponses</code> (real 403/429s observed) and{" "}
        <code>GittensoryQueueRateLimitDeferralsHigh</code> (a sustained deferral rate, not a blip)
        are tuned to alert on, rather than firing on every brief admission hold.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="promql"
        code={`# Deferrals broken down by token pool and job type over the last 10m
sum by (key_scope, job_type) (rate(gittensory_jobs_rate_limit_admission_deferred_total[10m]))

# Is one key_scope (e.g. a single installation token) the bottleneck?
topk(5, sum by (key_scope) (rate(gittensory_jobs_rate_limit_budget_deferred_total[10m])))

# Real rate-limit responses from GitHub itself (not just internal deferrals)
sum(rate(gittensory_github_rest_rate_limit_responses_total[10m]))`}
      />
      <p>
        If a single <code>key_scope=installation</code> pool is consistently the bottleneck, the fix
        is usually spreading load across more installation tokens (fewer repos per installation) or
        raising the GitHub App&apos;s own rate-limit tier, not code changes here.
      </p>

      <h2>Low GitHub response-cache hit rate</h2>
      <p>
        <code>gittensory_github_response_cache_total</code> (REST) and{" "}
        <code>gittensory_github_graphql_cache_total</code> (GraphQL) both carry a{" "}
        <code>result</code> label — <code>hit</code>, <code>miss</code>, <code>set</code>,{" "}
        <code>coalesced</code>, <code>bypassed</code>, or <code>error</code> — and a{" "}
        <code>class</code> label identifying the endpoint family. A healthy cache should show most
        traffic as <code>hit</code> for endpoints that are read repeatedly in one review/maintenance
        pass (PR reads, check-run lookups); a low hit rate on those specific classes, not the
        overall average, is the useful signal.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="promql"
        code={`# REST hit rate by endpoint class over the last 15m

      />

      <h2>Qdrant / vector-store errors</h2>
      <p>
        <code>gittensory_qdrant_errors_total</code> carries an <code>op</code> label (
        <code>upsert</code>, <code>query</code>, or <code>delete</code>) so you can tell whether
        indexing or retrieval is failing. <code>GittensoryQdrantErrorRateHigh</code> fires on a
        sustained error ratio, not an isolated blip.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Confirm <code>QDRANT_URL</code> (e.g. <code>http://qdrant:6333</code>) is reachable from
          the app container and the <code>qdrant</code> Compose profile is running.
        </li>
        <li>
          If Qdrant requires auth, confirm <code>QDRANT_API_KEY</code> is set and matches the Qdrant
          deployment&apos;s configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
          A dimension-mismatch error means the existing <code>gittensory</code> collection (the
          fixed collection name self-host always uses) was created with a different embedding model
          than the one currently configured (<code>AI_EMBED_MODEL</code>). Recreating it — delete
          the collection and let the next index run recreate it at the current width — is the fix,
          but it temporarily removes ALL indexed RAG context for every repo until re-indexing
          completes, so treat it as a deliberate, disruptive step, not a routine one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`curl "$QDRANT_URL/collections/gittensory"
docker compose --profile qdrant ps qdrant

# Only after confirming a dimension mismatch is the actual cause:
curl -X DELETE "$QDRANT_URL/collections/gittensory"`}
      />

      <h2>Orb export or relay problems</h2>
      <p>
        For brokered self-host deployments, <code>gittensory_orb_events_exported_total</code> and{" "}
        <code>gittensory_orb_export_errors_total</code> track the hourly outcome-export loop;{" "}
        <code>GittensoryOrbExportErrorRateHigh</code> fires on a sustained error ratio there. The
        pull-mode relay loop (for installations receiving events outbound from Orb) reports through{" "}
        <code>gittensory_orb_relay_drains_total</code> (<code>result=events</code> when it drained
        something, <code>result=empty</code> otherwise) and{" "}
        <code>gittensory_orb_webhook_total</code> (<code>event</code> + <code>result</code> labels)
        for what happened to each relayed event once enqueued locally.
      </p>
      <p>
        If exports are failing but the relay itself looks healthy, the export loop&apos;s Sentry
        cron monitor (see <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-operations">Self-host operations</Link>) is
        the fastest way to confirm whether the loop is even running, before digging into the error
        counters.
      </p>

      <h2>AI provider circuit breaker keeps opening</h2>
      <p>
        Each AI provider (self-host <code>AI_PROVIDER</code> entries) has its own circuit breaker:
        after 3 consecutive failures it stops attempting real calls to that provider for 60 seconds,
        recorded as <code>gittensory_ai_provider_circuit_open_total{'{provider="..."}'}</code>{" "}
        (skipped calls) alongside{" "}
        <code>gittensory_ai_provider_failures_total{'{provider="..."}'}</code> (real failures). It
        self-heals automatically — there is no manual reset — but it will reopen immediately if the
        underlying problem is still there.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Search logs for <code>circuit_open: provider "..."</code> to confirm which provider
          tripped, and <code>selfhost_ai_provider_failed_in_chain</code> for the real error each
          failed attempt hit before the breaker opened.
        </li>
        <li>
          A provider that keeps re-tripping after its cooldown almost always means a persistent
          problem, not a transient blip: an expired/invalid API key, a CLI binary missing from the
          image (see <code>selfhost_ai_cli_missing</code> at boot), or the endpoint being genuinely
          unreachable from the container.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>GittensoryAiProviderCircuitOpen</code> fires on any circuit-open event in a
          15-minute window — a single trip during a real but brief outage is expected; a rule that
          keeps firing across multiple windows points at the persistent case above.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Grafana traces error or show no data</h2>
      <p>
        The trace path is app or smoke process → OTEL collector → Tempo → Grafana. Tempo is only
        started by the observability profile, and app traces are only emitted when{" "}
        <code>OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER</code> includes <code>otlp</code>.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`docker compose --profile observability ps tempo otel-collector grafana
docker compose logs --tail=80 tempo otel-collector grafana

# Send one synthetic span through the collector and read it back from Tempo.
npm run test:smoke:observability`}
      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the smoke command fails at <code>otel-collector:4318/v1/traces</code>, the collector is
          not reachable from the app container.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it pushes successfully but cannot read{" "}
          <code>tempo:3200/api/traces/&lt;trace_id&gt;</code>, Tempo is unhealthy, not ingesting, or
          not sharing the Compose network.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the smoke command passes but Grafana Explore fails, check the Tempo data source URL. It
          should point at <code>http://tempo:3200</code>, not the OTLP ingest ports.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a temporary live debugging run, set <code>OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=1</code> so every
          root trace is sampled, then lower it again after diagnosis.
        </li>
      </ul>
