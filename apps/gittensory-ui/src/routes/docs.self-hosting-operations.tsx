docker compose logs -f gittensory
curl http://localhost:8787/ready
curl http://localhost:8787/metrics`}

      <h2>Observability profile</h2>
      <p>
        The observability profile starts Prometheus, Alertmanager, Loki, Promtail, and Grafana with
        dashboards for infra, review activity, and AI usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        When OpenTelemetry and Sentry are enabled, job audit logs and Sentry events include
        trace_id/span_id fields so an operator can jump from a failed job or issue to the matching
        trace in Grafana or Tempo.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`docker compose --profile observability up -d`} />

      <h2>Routine checks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Queue pending count is not growing without processing.</li>
        <li>Dead jobs stay at zero or are investigated promptly.</li>
        <li>Webhook deliveries are recent and have 2xx responses.</li>
        <li>AI usage matches expected review volume and model/effort choices.</li>
        <li>REES and RAG failures are visible and bounded.</li>
        <li>Backups are recent and restore-tested.</li>
      </ul>
