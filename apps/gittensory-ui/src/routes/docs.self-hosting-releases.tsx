      <h2>Prerelease (beta/rc) images</h2>
      <p>
        A tag like <code>orb-v0.1.0-rc.1</code> or <code>orb-v0.1.0-beta.1</code> runs the identical
        build/provenance/SBOM/Sentry pipeline as a stable release, but is marked prerelease on
        GitHub and is never pushed under <code>latest</code>. External beta testers should pull the
        exact prerelease tag, not <code>latest</code>.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`docker pull ghcr.io/jsonbored/gittensory-selfhost:orb-v0.1.0-rc.1`}
      />
      <Callout variant="note">
        Stable release behavior is unchanged: a plain <code>X.Y.Z</code> tag still moves{" "}
        <code>latest</code> and publishes an unmarked (non-prerelease) GitHub Release.
      </Callout>
      <Callout variant="safety">
        Before tagging any <code>orb-v*</code> release or prerelease, run the{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-release-checklist">beta release checklist</Link> against the
        built image — CI only smoke-tests the plain SQLite + Redis + direct-App default, not
        brokered mode, air-gapped mode, or any AI provider.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Upgrade flow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Read release notes for env, migration, or behavior changes.</li>
        <li>Back up the database or confirm Litestream health.</li>
        <li>
          Pull and restart with <code>scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh</code> (or rebuild the
          checkout with <code>scripts/deploy-selfhost-prebuilt.sh</code>) — both restart only the{" "}
          <code>gittensory</code> service (<code>--no-deps</code>) and wait for it to report{" "}
          <code>healthy</code> before returning, instead of a bare <code>docker compose up -d</code>{" "}
          that returns as soon as the container starts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check <code>/ready</code>, logs, queue metrics, and one test PR.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`# Recommended: pull a published tag, restart, wait for healthy
./scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh ghcr.io/jsonbored/gittensory-selfhost:orb-v0.1.0
curl http://localhost:8787/ready

# Building from the current checkout instead of pulling
./scripts/deploy-selfhost-prebuilt.sh`}
      />
      <Callout variant="note">
        Both scripts pin a version: the image script accepts a tag/digest argument or{" "}
        <code>GITTENSORY_IMAGE</code>; the prebuilt script derives <code>SENTRY_RELEASE</code>/
        <code>GITTENSORY_VERSION</code> from the checked-out commit (
        <code>git rev-parse --short=8 HEAD</code>) unless you set <code>SENTRY_RELEASE</code>{" "}
        yourself. A plain{" "}
        <code>docker compose pull gittensory &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d gittensory</code> still
        works, but skips the health-check wait loop and input validation both scripts provide.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Custom images</h2>
      <p>
        Custom builds are useful for testing local changes, including subscription CLIs, or trimming
        the image. They should not contain secrets. <code>INSTALL_AI_CLIS</code> (default{" "}
        <code>true</code>) installs the Claude Code and Codex CLIs; a sibling build-arg,{" "}
        <code>INSTALL_VISUAL_REVIEW</code> (default <code>false</code>), adds{" "}
        <code>puppeteer-core</code> for visual capture.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`docker compose build --build-arg INSTALL_AI_CLIS=true gittensory
docker compose up -d gittensory`}
      />

      <h2>Sentry source maps</h2>
      <Callout variant="note">
        Official releases align <code>GITTENSORY_VERSION</code>, Sentry release ids, and uploaded
        source maps. For custom images, leave <code>SENTRY_RELEASE</code> unset unless you uploaded
        source maps for that exact built bundle.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Rollback</h2>
      <p>
        There is no dedicated rollback command. Roll back by re-running{" "}
        <code>scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh</code> pinned to the prior image tag or digest (or{" "}
        <code>scripts/deploy-selfhost-prebuilt.sh</code> against an older checkout) — the same
        script you upgrade with, pointed backward.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="warn" title="Migrations are forward-only">
        This repo has no down-migration convention (<code>scripts/check-migrations.mjs</code> and{" "}
        <code>migrations/</code> only ever add forward). If a migration already ran forward before
        you need to roll back, reverting the app image does not revert the schema — the rolled-back
        code now runs against a newer schema than it expects. Keep backups and read release notes
        for migration changes before upgrading a live maintainer instance, and treat a
        post-migration rollback as a case that needs a manual schema/data plan, not just an image
        swap.
