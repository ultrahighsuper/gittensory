      <h2>Prerelease (beta/rc) images</h2>
      <p>
        A tag like <code>orb-v0.1.0-rc.1</code> or <code>orb-v0.1.0-beta.1</code> runs the identical
        build/provenance/SBOM/Sentry pipeline as a stable release, but is marked prerelease on
        GitHub and is never pushed under <code>latest</code>. External beta testers should pull the
        exact prerelease tag, not <code>latest</code>.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`docker pull ghcr.io/jsonbored/gittensory-selfhost:orb-v0.1.0-rc.1`}
      />
      <Callout variant="note">
        Stable release behavior is unchanged: a plain <code>X.Y.Z</code> tag still moves{" "}
        <code>latest</code> and publishes an unmarked (non-prerelease) GitHub Release.
      </Callout>
      <Callout variant="safety">
        Before tagging any <code>orb-v*</code> release or prerelease, run the{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-release-checklist">beta release checklist</Link> against the
        built image — CI only smoke-tests the plain SQLite + Redis + direct-App default, not
        brokered mode, air-gapped mode, or any AI provider.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Upgrade flow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Read release notes for env, migration, or behavior changes.</li>
        <li>Back up the database or confirm Litestream health.</li>
        <li>Pull the new image tag.</li>
        <li>Recreate the app container.</li>
        <li>
          Check <code>/ready</code>, logs, queue metrics, and one test PR.

        lang="bash"

curl http://localhost:8787/ready`}
      />

      <h2>Custom images</h2>
      <p>
        Custom builds are useful for testing local changes or including subscription CLIs. They
        should not contain secrets.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`docker compose build --build-arg INSTALL_AI_CLIS=true gittensory
docker compose up -d gittensory`}
      />

      <h2>Sentry source maps</h2>
      <Callout variant="note">
        Official releases align <code>GITTENSORY_VERSION</code>, Sentry release ids, and uploaded
        source maps. For custom images, leave <code>SENTRY_RELEASE</code> unset unless you uploaded
        source maps for that exact built bundle.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Rollback</h2>
      <p>
        Roll back by pinning the prior image tag and recreating the container. Database migrations
        can make rollback harder, so keep backups and read release notes before upgrading a live
        maintainer instance.
