      <h2>1. Copy the sample env</h2>
      <p>
        <code>.env.selfhost.example</code> is the short path: required secrets plus a conservative
        first-boot config, with nothing about the Cloudflare Worker deploy. Copy it and fill in the
        placeholders — keep your real <code>.env</code> out of git and prefer mounted secret files
        for multiline values like the GitHub App private key.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`cp .env.selfhost.example .env
# edit .env`}
      />
      <Callout variant="note">
        <code>.env.selfhost.example</code> already ships a conservative starting config —{" "}
        <code>dry-run</code> mode, a small repo allowlist, unified comments, safety, and grounding,
        with AI, RAG, and REES left off. Switch to live only after webhook delivery, logs, and
        review output match expectations. For every optional env var (observability, backup,
        additional AI providers) see <code>.env.example</code>'s self-host section or the{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-configuration">generated reference table</Link>.
      </Callout>

      <h2>2. Choose your AI provider (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        Skip this step for a fully deterministic review (no AI). Otherwise uncomment ONE of the
        three blocks below in <code>.env.selfhost.example</code> — they're mutually exclusive, each
        sets its own <code>AI_PROVIDER</code>. The self-host image bundles both CLIs by default;
        credentials and provider choice are runtime-only.

      <Callout variant="warn" title="Codex is fail-closed by default">
        Codex stores its OAuth credential in <code>auth.json</code> on the same filesystem that
        prompt-influenced reviews can read, so it requires explicit opt-in (
        <code>GITTENSORY_ENABLE_UNSAFE_CODEX_REVIEWER=1</code>) and a mounted{" "}
        <code>/data/codex</code> auth volume. Claude Code has no equivalent restriction. See{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-ai-providers">AI providers</Link> for the full reference.
      </Callout>

      <h2>3. Boot the stack</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Recommended: pull the published image.</strong> No local build, no Node toolchain —
        the script pulls, restarts, and waits for the health check to pass.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`./scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh
curl http://localhost:8787/health
curl http://localhost:8787/ready`}
      />
      <p>
        Pin a specific release instead of <code>:latest</code>, or point at your own registry:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`./scripts/deploy-selfhost-image.sh ghcr.io/jsonbored/gittensory-selfhost:orb-v0.1.0

      />
      <Callout variant="note" title="Building from source instead">
        Contributors and anyone customizing the Dockerfile can still build locally —{" "}
        <code>docker compose up -d --build</code> builds the <code>gittensory</code> service from
        the checkout instead of pulling a published image. Everything else in this quickstart (env,
        health checks, GitHub App) is identical either way.
      </Callout>
      <FeatureRow
        items={[
          {
            title: "/health",

        ]}
      />

      <h2>4. Install or connect the GitHub App</h2>
      <p>
        Point your App webhook to <code>https://your-host.example/v1/github/webhook</code>, set the
        same webhook secret in <code>GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET</code>, install the App on one test repo,
        and open a small PR. The direct App and Orb modes are covered in{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-github-app">GitHub App and Orb</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Watch the first review</h2>
      <p>Look for these logs during boot and the first webhook:</p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`selfhost_listening
selfhost_migrations_applied
selfhost_ai_provider          # only when AI_PROVIDER is set
selfhost_job_dead             # investigate immediately if present
review_context_fetch_failed   # REES/RAG/grounding context failure`}
      />
      <p>
        A cold first boot on SQLite commonly logs a one-time{" "}
        <code>selfhost_migrations_applied</code> burst and a brief Redis connection retry while the
        sidecar finishes starting — both are expected and stop once the stack is warm. Anything else
        that looks wrong, or a <code>/ready</code> that stays unhealthy past a couple minutes, is
        covered in <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the deterministic path is stable, continue with{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-configuration">Configuration</Link> and then layer in AI, REES,
        or RAG deliberately.
      </p>

      <h2>Defaults at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing below needs a flag to start; everything past the first row needs an explicit{" "}
        <code>--profile</code> (combine freely) or an explicit <code>AI_PROVIDER</code>.
