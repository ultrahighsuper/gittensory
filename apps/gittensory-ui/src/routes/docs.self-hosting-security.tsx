      <FeatureRow
        items={[
          {
            title: "Never bake secrets",
            description:
              "Images should not contain .env files, private keys, API keys, webhook secrets, REES secrets, or CLI auth files.",

          },
        ]}
      />

      <h2>Private policy</h2>
      <p>
        Keep sensitive review thresholds, autonomy, maintainer notes, and repo-specific rules in
        <code>GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR</code>, not in public repo config.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock filename=".env" code={`GITTENSORY_REPO_CONFIG_DIR=/config`} />

      <h2>Network exposure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Expose the webhook endpoint only through TLS.</li>
        <li>Keep Prometheus, Grafana, Qdrant, Ollama, and database ports private by default.</li>
        <li>Put an auth layer in front of dashboards and internal admin routes.</li>
        <li>
          Use <code>/ready</code> for orchestrators, not as a public status surface.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Control-panel access</h2>
      <p>
        GitHub sign-in to the control panel (the maintainer/owner dashboard) is gated by{" "}
        <code>ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGINS</code> — a comma- or whitespace-separated, case-insensitive
        allowlist of GitHub logins.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".env"
        code={`ADMIN_GITHUB_LOGINS=your-github-login,a-second-maintainer`}
      />
      <Callout variant="warn" title="Fail-closed by design">
        Unset or empty means NOBODY gets control-panel access — not even the person who just
        finished setup. This is intentional, not a bug: add your own GitHub login here right after
        first-run setup, or you will sign in successfully and see zero privileges with no
        explanation. The same allowlist also exempts these logins from the agent's own-PR auto-close
        rules and lets them bypass per-repo MCP scope (<code>MCP_READ_REPO_ALLOWLIST</code> /{" "}
        <code>MCP_ACTUATION_REPO_ALLOWLIST</code>).
      </Callout>

      <h2>AI credential boundaries</h2>
      <Callout variant="warn" title="Subscription CLI credentials">
        CLI auth files can be readable by the runtime. Do not mount a prompt-readable Claude Code or
        Codex home into review execution unless you have intentionally isolated it. API-key and
        local model providers are easier to reason about operationally.
      </Callout>

      <h2>REES boundary</h2>
      <p>
        REES receives PR diff and file metadata. Use a private network URL when possible, require
        <code>REES_SHARED_SECRET</code>, and remember that the engine treats REES output as
        untrusted advisory context.
      </p>

      <h2>Public output boundary</h2>
      <p>
        Public PR comments and checks must not leak secrets, private policy, provider credentials,
        private scoring context, or maintainer-only notes. For hosted and self-host boundaries, keep
        <Link to="/docs/privacy-security"> Privacy and security</Link> nearby.
      </p>
    </DocsPage>
