// workflow docs to the miner's observability setup. Keeping the callout — and its link target — in one place keeps
// the wording byte-identical across all three routes instead of relying on three hand-copied copies staying in sync.
//
// The target is the in-repo "Observing your miner" guide (landed in #5190): the single AMS observability entry point,
// which itself covers pointing Grafana at the redacted AMS ledger datasources AND loading an AMS dashboard from
// grafana/dashboards/. It is a markdown guide, not an in-app /docs/* route, so a GitHub-blob link is the correct
// target here — the same convention the docs already use for in-repo file references (see docs.self-hosting-configuration.tsx).
