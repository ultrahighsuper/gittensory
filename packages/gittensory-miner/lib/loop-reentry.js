// Closed-loop discovery re-entry orchestrator (#2338): the real-IO half of "on a resolved outcome (merged, or
// rejected-and-disengaged), automatically re-invoke discovery to select the next candidate." The DECISION
// itself (shouldReenter, @jsonbored/gittensory-engine) is pure; this module owns everything that decision
// needs real state for -- reading the repo's own pr_outcome history to compute the per-repo consecutive-
// disengagement tally, reading recent re-entry events for the hourly/session rate cap, and (only when allowed)
// actually dequeuing the next candidate and transitioning run-state.
//
// NOT WIRED INTO ANY AUTOMATIC SCHEDULE: per this issue's own "manual owner sign-off before enabling by
// default in any profile" deliverable, this is a callable function ready for that sign-off -- it is not invoked
// by manage-poll.js or any cron/scheduler as part of this change.
//
// AUDITABILITY: every call appends exactly one `loop_reentry_decision` event to the ledger, whether or not the
// decision allowed re-entry, so the full decision trail (including every suppressed re-entry and why) survives
// independently of this function's own return value.
