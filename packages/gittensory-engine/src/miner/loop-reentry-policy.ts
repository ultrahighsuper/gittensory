// Closed-loop discovery re-entry policy (#2338): the pure decision half of "on a resolved outcome (merged, or
// rejected-and-disengaged), automatically re-invoke discovery to select the next candidate." Deliberately split
// from the miner-side orchestrator (packages/gittensory-miner/lib/loop-reentry.js), which owns the REAL IO --
// reading recent event-ledger history to compute the tallies this policy consumes, dequeuing the next
// candidate, and transitioning run-state -- mirroring this session's established engine (pure) / miner-lib
// (stateful) split for every other governor primitive.
//
// TOP SLOP-AT-SCALE RISK: this issue's own framing calls out "a bug here (re-entering too fast, ignoring a
// circuit-breaker, or looping on a permanently-rejected repo) is the top slop-at-scale risk for the whole miner
// subsystem." Both failure modes get an INDEPENDENT hard ceiling here, neither one masking the other:
//   - A per-repo circuit breaker: N consecutive disengaged (rejected) outcomes on the SAME repo pauses further
//     re-entry for that repo, regardless of how much of the hour/session rate budget remains.
//   - A hard rate/session cap: independent of any repo's own history, a conservative ceiling on how many
//     re-entries may fire in a rolling hour or across the whole session.
// Both reasons are collected (not short-circuited) so a caller logging the decision sees every ceiling that
// was hit, not just the first one checked.
