// Barrel export for @jsonbored/gittensory-engine.
//
// This package houses the deterministic, side-effect-free logic shared by the Gittensory review-stack
// backend and the gittensory-miner (scoring preview/model, predicted-gate types, reward-risk, slop signals,
// focus-manifest parse/compile core, duplicate-winner adjudication, and their engine-parity fixtures).
// More modules land in follow-up issues.
