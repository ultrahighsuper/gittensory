## [3.0.0](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/compare/engine-v2.0.0...engine-v3.0.0) (2026-07-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **build:** every gittensory-prefixed directory under apps/ and packages/ is now loopover-prefixed, and the two extension packages' npm names changed from @jsonbored/gittensory-* to @loopover/*. No dual-path/alias, per the epic's full-cutover mandate.

### Features

* **build:** Phase 5 - full-cutover rename all gittensory-* directories to loopover-* ([#5743](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/5743)) ([81e4ac3](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/commit/81e4ac34dfb4dee9c3cadefcc27a515617462da9))

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/compare/engine-v1.0.0...engine-v2.0.0) (2026-07-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **miner:** the miner's default config directory and every gittensory_miner_* Prometheus metric name changed; no dual-read/alias, per the epic's full-cutover mandate ([#5705](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/5705)). A self-hoster's existing ~/.config/gittensory-miner state does not migrate automatically.
* **github:** the bot no longer recognizes @gittensory as a command trigger anywhere -- only @loopover works. Any saved PR-comment template, bookmark, or muscle-memory referencing @gittensory <command> must be updated to @loopover <command>.
* **miner:** every LOOPOVER_MINER_*/LOOPOVER_API_TOKEN_FILE/ LOOPOVER_MCP_TOKEN_FILE/LOOPOVER_MEM_LIMIT/LOOPOVER_REPORTING_* env var an existing self-hosted AMS/miner deployment sets must be renamed to its LOOPOVER_ equivalent -- the old names are no longer read.
* remove gittensory-engine's settings.gateCheckMode yml back-compat parsing ([#5373](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/5373)) (#5463)
