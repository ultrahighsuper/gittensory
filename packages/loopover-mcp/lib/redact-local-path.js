// #6264: the one shared local-filesystem-path redactor for the MCP CLI. Three call sites used to
// carry their own copy of this logic (`redactLocalPath` here, `redactLocalValidationPaths` and
// `sanitizeDiagnosticText` in bin/loopover-mcp.js), so a single redaction fix had to be made — and
// kept in sync — three times. They are consolidated here so a future fix happens once.
//
// Two genuinely different mechanisms are needed, so both stay available as named functions rather
// than being forced into one:
//   - `redactLocalPath`      DETECTS an unknown absolute/home path in free text via a regex heuristic
//                            (stack traces, scorer stderr, pasted validation output) → `<local-path>`.
//   - `redactKnownLocalPaths` redacts KNOWN sensitive strings (session tokens, config dirs, cwd/home)
//                            supplied by the caller, by exact substring substitution → `[redacted]` /
//                            `[local-path]`. It cannot detect an arbitrary path; the heuristic cannot
//                            redact a token it was never told about. Each solves a distinct problem.

/**
 * Redact any absolute or home-anchored local path found in free text, replacing it with the
 * `<local-path>` placeholder. Heuristic (matches an unknown path by shape), so it never needs the
 * concrete path in advance — the counterpart to the exact-match `redactKnownLocalPaths` below.
