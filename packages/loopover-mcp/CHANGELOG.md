# Changelog

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/JSONbored/loopover/compare/mcp-v1.0.0...mcp-v2.0.0) (2026-07-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **config:** every GITTENSORY_* environment variable is now LOOPOVER_*. No dual-read/alias, per the epic's full-cutover mandate. Operators must rename these in their .env / secrets before deploying this change.
* **build:** every gittensory-prefixed directory under apps/ and packages/ is now loopover-prefixed, and the two extension packages' npm names changed from @jsonbored/gittensory-* to @loopover/*. No dual-path/alias, per the epic's full-cutover mandate.

### Features

* **build:** Phase 5 - full-cutover rename all gittensory-* directories to loopover-* ([#5743](https://github.com/JSONbored/loopover/issues/5743)) ([81e4ac3](https://github.com/JSONbored/loopover/commit/81e4ac34dfb4dee9c3cadefcc27a515617462da9))
* **config:** Phase 6 - full-cutover rename internal GITTENSORY_* constants to LOOPOVER_* ([#5750](https://github.com/JSONbored/loopover/issues/5750)) ([12958f4](https://github.com/JSONbored/loopover/commit/12958f4f36cbf1f9f1ac732e718a4316e91cb103)), closes [#5705](https://github.com/JSONbored/loopover/issues/5705)

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/compare/mcp-v0.9.0...mcp-v1.0.0) (2026-07-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **cli:** `gittensory-miner`, `gittensory-miner-mcp`, and `gittensory-mcp` no longer exist as installed binaries; use `loopover-miner`, `loopover-miner-mcp`, and `loopover-mcp`. No dual-read/alias, per the epic's full-cutover mandate. A global npm install/link of the old package names must be reinstalled.

### Features

* **cli:** Phase 3 - full-cutover rename CLI binaries to loopover-* ([#5728](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/5728)) ([f2ee2ad](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/commit/f2ee2ad24e0bf01d0a2dfd8f39421bb80aa527b6))

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/compare/mcp-v0.8.1...mcp-v0.9.0) (2026-07-14)


### Features

* **mcp:** wire gittensory_feasibility_gate's claimStatus to the local claim ledger ([#5157](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/5157)) ([#5389](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/5389)) ([91b235d](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/commit/91b235dbc4c9e3c818ff0a76e98f087c1f3ec8c2))

## [0.7.1](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/compare/mcp-v0.7.0...mcp-v0.7.1) (2026-07-08)


### Fixes

* **release:** sync package-lock.json via script, not release-please extra-files ([#4179](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/4179)) ([b614317](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/commit/b614317e506fab3b30bf7fc366d67e268952ba02))
